Welcome to Smart-AI-Detection-For-Medical-Emergency-Vechicles – an expertly curated vehicle detection dataset built from the Open Images dataset using the OIDv4 Toolkit. This project offers a focused dataset of 627 labeled images across multiple vehicle types to help train and evaluate object detection systems.

🚀 Problem Statement
Objective
The goal of AutoSight is to provide a lightweight yet diverse dataset that enables:

🚘 Detection and classification of vehicle types: car, bus, motorcycle, ambulance, and truck

🧠 Training of smart object detection models for autonomous driving applications

🧪 Benchmarking and testing of object detectors in dense traffic and ambulance-heavy scenes

🏥 Fine-tuning and development of ambulance detection systems for emergency response AI

🗂️ Dataset Overview
Images: 627

Classes: Car, Bus, Motorcycle, Ambulance, Truck

Format: JPEG images with bounding box labels (in PASCAL VOC or YOLO format, depending on toolkit configuration)

Source: Extracted using the OIDv4 Toolkit
